## Flappy Bird


## About
Flappy Bird is a simple but addictive game I built with Python and Pygame. You control a bird, flapping through pipes to avoid crashing while earning points. I made this to practice game mechanics like collisions and dynamic difficulty.


## Features
1. Tap the spacebar to make the bird flap and navigate pipe gaps.
2. Pipe gaps get smaller as your score and time increase, upping the challenge.
3. Day/night mode switches after 10 seconds, changing the bird, pipes, and background.
4. Score points for each pipe passed, with time and score displayed on-screen.
5. Start screen (press space) and game-over screen (restart with 'R').
6. Smooth 60 FPS gameplay with a scrolling ground effect.


## How to Play
1. Press spacebar to make the bird flap and fly higher.
2. Guide the bird through gaps in the pipes without hitting them or the ground.
3. Earn 1 point per pipe passed; survive as long as you can!
4. If you crash, press 'R' to restart from the game-over screen.
